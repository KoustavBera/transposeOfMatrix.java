# Transpose of Matrix in Java

This program takes a matrix as input and returns its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix.

## How to run the program

To run the program, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can compile the program using the command:

`javac TransposeMatrix.java`

Then, you can run the program using the command:

`java TransposeMatrix`

The program will prompt you to enter the number of rows and columns of the matrix, and then the elements of the matrix. After that, it will display the original matrix and the transpose matrix.

## Example output

Here is an example output of the program:

```
Enter total rows and columns: 
3
3
Enter matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
The above matrix before Transpose is 
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
The above matrix after Transpose is 
1 4 7 
2 5 8 
3 6 9 


I hope this helps you with your project. ðŸ˜Š
